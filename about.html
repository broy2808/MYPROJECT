                  <p><q>The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams.</q>--Oprah Winfrey</p>
                  <p>The phrase keeps popping up in my mind. I am Bony, my journey from a small town in India to the United States is full of ups and downs. I strongly believe you should not settle down in life till you are satisfied with what you are doing. Since childhood, I am an avid reader who loves mathematics and drawing. I used to love solving mathematical puzzles. I thought my interest is in electronics, so joined a University in India to complete my bachelors in Electronics engineering. But soon towards the end of my bachelors, I realized my interest is in Computer Science. So, to pursue my dreams I joined a multinational IT company in India. After spending 2.5 years at that company, I realized this is not the type of Job I am looking for. I would love to learn more about core Computer Science and solve interest problems. So, I started preparing for pursuing a masters degrees.</p>

                    <p><q>Be sure you put your feet in the right place, then stand firm.</q>  --Abraham Lincoln</p>
                    <p>Finally, after that long eventful journey, I came to the USA in Fall'18 to pursue Masters in Computer Science. This is like my dream come true moment. I am currently working with a lot of interesting and creative minds. I'm learning new concepts of computer science every day and I love it. I had some experience with C++(Intermediatory level) at my bachelor's degree and  worked in ERP, SQL, HTML5, CSS at my previous company. Currently, I am learning Python(Doing a project in Python using Flask framework, basic -4 months) and Javascript. I am revising C++ concepts every day by implementing various data structure and algorithms. Also, my goal is to complete the basics of AWS or cloud computing in general by January-19.</p>

                    <h2><b>What I hope to do<b></h2>
                    <p>I hope to make a small contribution in the world with my work. I hope to do my best in software development field and bring some interesting ideas out of my mind. So, looking for an organisation who would offer me summer-19 internship opportunity. Lastly, I owe a lot to my sisters and parents.
                      They are there when no one is beside me and helped me a lot in every phases of my life. So,my only plan is to get better personally and professionally. I hope to be a better person everyday.</p>
